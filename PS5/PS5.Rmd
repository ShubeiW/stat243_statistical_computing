## 1.

Denote $\Lambda_{ii}=\lambda_{i},1\leqq i\leqq n$($\lambda_{i}$ is the $i^{th}$ eigenvalue), so $|\Lambda|=\Pi_i^n \lambda_{i}$. And because $\Gamma$ is an orthogonal matrix of eigenvectors, $|\Gamma|=|\Gamma^T|=1$. So $A =\Gamma \Lambda \Gamma^T \rightarrow |A| =|\Gamma| |\Lambda|| \Gamma^T|\rightarrow |A| = 1*\Pi_i^n \lambda_{i}*1=\Pi_i^n \lambda_{i}$, i.e. $|A|$ is the product of the eigenvalues.

## 2.

Because when $z$ is large the expression will cause overflow. The $exp(z)$ term will be *Inf* in R and the $expit$ function will be *NaN*. To avoid this we can re-express it as $expit(z)=\frac{1}{1+exp(-z)}$. This function will return 1 when $z$ takes very large values.

## 3.

Because we can only accurately present about 16 digits, x will lost accuracy after 4 decimal places. Thus their variance won't be the same and will be accurate to about 4 places. In this case they agree to 5 digits.

# (a)

Because in this case each task takes little time and the communication overhead of starting and stopping the tasks will reduce efficiency. So it's better to separate
the computation into $p$ tasks.

# (b)

Assume each element in X, Y takes up $a$ bytes.

A:

(1) The memory used=$4n^2a$ bytes.
(2) The communication cost$=n^3+2n^2$

B:
(1) The memory used=$(4n^2+p^3)a$
(2) The communication cost=$p^2(2n^2/p+m^2)=2n^2p+n^2$

We can conclude that A is better for minimizing memory use and B is for minimizing communication.
